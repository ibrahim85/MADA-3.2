EVALUATION_FEATURES = diac




# Should the new feature tag sets be reduced to the old (version 2.32 and earlier) MADA feature tag 
#  sets before comparing and evaluating?  For example, mapping prc2 values to the old conj values (YES,NO, NA).
#
# Valid choices = YES | NO

MAP_TAGS = NO


# Should the evaluation report include a list of all the errors found? If not, only global accuracy statistics will
# be output.
# Valid choices = YES | NO
